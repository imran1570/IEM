**Inference Enterprise Modeling**: An IEM is a model of an inference enterprise that forecasts the performance of existing and hypothesized inference enterprises in making the correct inferences.

This repo is for the **Scientific advances to Continuous Insider Threat Evaluation (SCITE)** program. 

The SCITE program is focused on modeling and forecasting the performance of the automated portion of an insider threat detection enterprise (detectors, indicators and algorithms) in detecting users who satisfy analyst-specified definitions of potential threats (e.g., users who are substantially dissatisfied with work, strongly object to certain policies, actively engaged in espionage activities, proactively hiding undeclared sources of income, etc.).
